### How to make your future data team hate you

Most companies are so busy getting their product and team set up that they don't think to get business logging audited. Fast forward a year or two when they can slow down and hire a data scientist: logs are missing! Critical info isn't logged, so joins are impossible! Years of insight, down the drain, all for lack of a few days work and the data know-how up front. Learn the most common mistakes made and how to prevent them. Bonus: you can use this work to show prospective data hires that you have your shit together and they'll be able to hit the ground running. 

(data science, data engineering, startups, hiring)

### Command line tools for data scientists

Hadoop is great for handling large amounts of data quickly, but what about your first few minutes with a data set? I'll talk about a few tools that will help you quickly get a handle on data files to get intuition for the data set, and make sure everything's there, and do it all right from the command line. 

(data science, unix, bash, sed, awk, eda, cli)

### Creating culture

"Culture" does not mean ping-pong tables. "Culture fit" does not mean "would be my friend." It can be hard to see your culture when you're embedded in itâ€”learn how to see your company's culture objectively and get concrete tips for influencing it it to hire more effectively and shape your company's trajectory.

(culture, hiring, leadership, startups)

### Maximizing Impact/LOC

Software doesn't necessarily have to be extensive or beautiful to be impactful. Two case studies of minimal code having a big effect on community. 

(software architecture)

### How I got 100 people to my first meetup (and kept them coming back)

Lessons learned from launching [a community](http://womenwhocode.com) from scratch. Would be a much more polished & thoughtful version of [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_hQV6fiJD0).

(culture, startups)

### Other less-fleshed-out ideas: 

- Data cleaning with pipelines (great opportunity to use Mario clip art)
- Why that 'algorithmic complexity' you read about on Coursera really matters
- How being a teacher was amazing preparation for my tech career. 
- Transitioning into the tech industry/a new career (I get asked this a lot)
- Choosing the right hammer (some thoughts on picking the right tool for the job making your life a lot easier). the value of having a lot of tools in your belt. data structures, etc.
- Don't hire opinionated developers. Why [37signals](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/2628-how-to-hire-a-programmer-when-youre-not-a-programmer) is wrong.
